Module 1 Challenge - Optimization Ticket
The challenge was to optimize the webpage to be accessible; Acting as a programmer given starter code and a criteria to improve the website. 
For accessibility features I focused on color contrast and image alternative descriptions. 
Further, I attempted to fix some of the alignment and content by changing around the dimensions to be more responsive as the display sizes changed.
Lastly I began to implement Google suggested code to streamline responsiveness and SEO function.

Further Updates Required **
Fixing with and margins at smaller device dimensions
Fixing or hiding navigation bar items to prevent overlaying
Shrinking image sizes for faster load times; boosting performance checks
